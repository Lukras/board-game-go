# board-game-go
Ancient Chinese board game Go with 2-player network functionality (work in progress).

Currently, the game supports matches via LAN only, where one player acts as the host and the other joins the match.
If you want to play, either download go.jar and the icons folder and put them in the same directory, or download the source code if you want to build it yourself.
If you have Java installed on your device, you can run the game from the terminal using `java -jar go.jar`. Enjoy!
