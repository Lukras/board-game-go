# Board game Go (work in progress)

Ancient Chinese board game Go with 2-player network functionality. Currently, only matches via LAN are possible.
If you want to play, either download go.jar (see releases) and the icons folder and put them in the same directory, or download the source code if you want to build it yourself.
In order to run this game, you need Java installed on your device. You can run it from the terminal using `java -jar go.jar`. Enjoy!
